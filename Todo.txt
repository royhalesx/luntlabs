Graphing interface - Switch to the website api? 

Make it able to go through folders of data and read all of them

Add methods to better interpret the data over a larger scale (make it easier to graph)?

Make it so that you can return all the values of one vector in one attribute

Add a progress bar?

Store data so we don't have to run the interpreter everytime we look at the graph

Make it an application so it can be used on the linux machines
